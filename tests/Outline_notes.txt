Basic parametric course outline:

1.
Quick Bayes intro
	emphasize distributions
R/Rstudio input output
Graphs
	hist, BW, scatter with example data
Packages
	Stan install, rstan
	JAGS, R2jags
	Trouble shooting
HW - run test scripts and make sure you get what I get

2.
Single parameter methods
	Some theory 
	practice coding in Stan and JAGS
	Example problems/class coding
	Basic diagnostic assessment and interpretation

3.
Multi parameter methods
	practice coding in Stan and JAGS
	Example problems/class coding (As lab?)
	Basic diagnostic assessment and interpretation

4. 
MCMC, Gibbs and HMC 
	HW??

5.
Linear Regression
	(Simplest ARM/WinBUGS models)
	Shinystan diagnostics
	Plotting
	Interpretation
	Code these in Stan and JAGS

6.
Hierarchical Regression
linear

pines by bridge sampling
wacky bayes factor with prior
